To better understand the tectonic evolution of West Junggar in the western Altaids, we have conducted a
combined paleomagnetic and geochronological study on Late Devonian (D3), Late Carboniferous (C2) and Early
Permian (P1) successions from the Tacheng Basin, northwest of China. Both primary and secondary characteristic
remanent magnetization components have been successfully isolated and yield three reliable paleomagnetic
poles of C2 and Late Permian (P2) ages. The C2 and P2 poles reveal a signi?cant clockwise rotation of
35.6∼ ㊣ 10.4∼ which is comparable to the rotation deduced in the western part of the Chingiz Range during
the time interval C2 to P2. Similar rotation patterns for the two units suggest that the Chingiz每West Junggar
has remained as a quasi-rigid block by the P2 time and constituted the northeast limb of the Kazakhstan Orocline.
The differential rotation of ca. 25∼ to 30∼ deduced between the northeast and middle limbs of the Kazakhstan
Orocline further suggests that at least a part of the curvature of the Balkhash Arc was acquired during the C2 to
P2 interval and was a continuation of the middle Paleozoic oroclinal bending. Moreover, the C2 poles for West
Junggar and the Junggar Block are signi?cantly different while the P2 ones almost overlap supporting the view
that ?nal closure of the Balkhash每Junggar Ocean occurred during the C2 to P2 interval. On the other hand, a
large-scale counterclockwise rotation of ca. 80∼ to 90∼ is observed in West Junggar and Junggar relative to the
western part of the Chingiz Range since the P2 time, and this rotation probably represents an important intra-
continental deformation within the western part of the Altaids. A reconstruction of the Paleo-Asian Ocean has
been proposed in which the Kazakhstan Orocline was emphasized by using the paleomagnetic results and
geological evidence.

1. Introduction

The Altaid tectonic domain is one of the largest accretionary collages
in the world and records the closure history of the Paleo-Asian Ocean
(PAO) where major blocks now comprising Tarim, Junggar and North
China were sutured to the Pangea supercontinent in Late Paleozoic
and/or Early Mesozoic times (?eng?r et al., 1993; ?eng?r and Natal'in,
1996; Windley et al., 2007; Xiao et al., 2010, Fig. 1a). Although the
model of shearing and buckling of a single long-lived Kipchak Arc
(?eng?r et al., 1993; ?eng?r and Natal'in, 1996) cannot satisfactorily
explain the orogenic history of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB)
(e.g. Xiao et al., 2010), the large-scale block rotation and strike-slip
faulting predicted by this model are widely observed (e.g. Van der Voo
et al., 2006; Abrajevitch et al., 2007, 2008; Wang et al., 2007; Choulet

et al., 2011). West Junggar is located at a key position within the CAOB
and the kinematics is closely related to a series of important geodynamic
processes generally involved in accretionary orogeny such as oroclinal
bending, oblique convergence and subduction (Choulet et al., 2012),
ridge subduction (Geng et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2011) and large-scale
wrench faulting (Wang et al., 2007; Choulet et al., 2011, 2012, in
press). For this reason, the tectonic history of West Junggar during the
Late Paleozoic can potentially make an important contribution to
understanding the tectonics of the CAOB as well as geodynamics of
accretionary orogeny and continental growth.
Several models have been proposed recently to explain the large-
scale block rotation and wrench tectonics observed in surrounding
areas of West Junggar during the Late Paleozoic and an important
contribution of paleomagnetism to this tectonism is the conformation
of oroclinal bending of the Kazakhstan volcanic arcs. In the area of the
Lake Balkhash, ca. 180∼ of relative rotation has been observed between
the northern (Chingiz Range) and southern (North Tianshan) arms
during the Late Paleozoic and the curvature of bending could be restored
during each stage of the Paleozoic (Collins et al., 2003; Levashova et al.,

et al., 2007; Abrajevitch et al., 2008; Levashova et al., 2009, 2012). How-
ever, due to poor data coverage especially in the northeast limb of the
Chingiz Range, it is not clear whether the observed rotation should be

interpreted as oroclinal bending or as a consequence of local deforma-
tion caused by the Permian strike-slip faulting (Van der Voo et al.,
2006; Abrajevitch et al., 2008). Moreover, although this strongly curved
volcanic domain is evidently an important facet of the tectonic evolution

of Kazakhstan region during the Late Paleozoic, whether West Junggar,
which is a likely extension of the Chingiz Arc, has experienced similar
rotation is not yet clari?ed. For these reasons, further paleomagnetic
studies are required to further clarify the signi?cance of oroclinal
bending in the Kazakhstan and West Junggar (Abrajevitch et al., 2008).
Some attempts have been made recently to interpret and quantify
displacements on the major strike-slip faults in Central Asia. Based on
late Paleozoic paleomagnetic data from the Yili and Junggar blocks and
geometries of the strike-slip faults, Wang et al. (2007) proposed a
model of eastward wedging of a combined Yili每Junggar Block into
Siberia and Tarim between Late Carboniferous (C2) and Late Permian
(P2) times. In the light of updated paleomagnetic data from West
Junggar, Choulet et al. (2011, in press) revised this model and de?ned
an important rotation between the Junggar and Yili blocks since the P2
times. Although this rotation is compatible with the dextral strike-slip
faulting observed from the Northern Tianshan Fault, in view of the
tectonic complexity of this area some facts probably require further con-
sideration. For example, the paleomagnetic data used to position West
Junggar in Choulet et al.'s (2011) model were con?ned to the Karamay
and Hoboksar units at the western margin of the Junggar Basin
(Fig. 1b). However, the Karamay unit probably represents an intra-
oceanic arc before, and part of the Darbut suture zone after, closure of
the Darbut Ocean (Zhang et al., 2011, Fig. 1b) and important relative
rotation could thus have occurred during block amalgamation, ridge
subduction reworking and strike-slip faulting along the Darbut Fault.
Available paleomagnetic data from this area are evidently inadequate
for constraining relative motions between West Junggar and the
adjacent areas. In contrast to the southeastern margin of West Junggar,
no late Paleozoic paleomagnetic data have yet been reported from the
western part of this unit. In this study, we conduct a combined paleo-
magnetic and geochronological study on late Paleozoic rocks in the
Tacheng Basin of West Junggar to provide further constraints on the
oroclinal bending of the Kazakhstan Orocline, closure of the Junggar
Ocean and wrench tectonics around Junggar and adjacent areas during
Late Paleozoic to Mesozoic interval. To avoid possible complications
due to local tectonism we have located our study area relatively far
away from the large-scale strike-slip faulting in this region (Fig. 1).

2. Geological setting and paleomagnetic sampling

2.1. Geological background

The structure of the PAO tectonic domain is shown in Fig. 1a where
the primary tectonic framework comprises the European and Siberia
cratons in the east and north, and the Tarim and North China cratons
in the south. The wide triangular area between these cratons is
abbreviated as the ※CAOB§ (Zonenshain et al., 1990) or ※the Altaids§
(?eng?r et al., 1993) and includes much of Kazakhstan, Mongolia and
the northern part of China. The ※West Junggar§ is basically a geographic
term, and refers to the area surrounded by the Junggar Basin to the east,
Tianshan Range to the south and the Altay Mountains to the north; the
national boundary between China and Kazakhstan forms the western
boundary. However, the tectonic settings for different parts of this
area are probably different and it is necessary to clarify the relationship
between West Junggar and adjacent geological units before we address
a de?nition of West Junggar.
The western margin of West Junggar is connected to Kazakhstan
where the geological setting is highlighted by three age groups of
island-arc magmatism; these are (1) Ordovician每Silurian of Kazakhstan
and Northern Tianshan; (2) Early and Middle Devonian intermediate
and acid volcanic rocks and granitoids; and (3) Carboniferous and
Permian intermediate and acid volcanic rocks and granitoids. The
concentric horseshoe-shaped volcanic belts encircle the Lake Balkhash
and become younger toward the inner zone (Levashova et al., 2012)
and the unique shapes of the arcs and subduction zone lead to the
assumption of an orocline (e.g. Bogdanov, 1965). Paleomagnetic

reconstruction further suggests that the Kazakhstan Arc was initially a
rectilinear structure trending approximately NW每SE during the Early
Paleozoic with oroclinal bending taking place during the Devonian每
Early Carboniferous and ending in the Permian (Collins et al., 2003;
Levashova et al., 2003a,b; Van der Voo et al., 2006; Abrajevitch et al.,
2007; Levashova et al., 2007; Abrajevitch et al., 2008; Levashova et al.,
2009, 2012). The Kazakhstan Orocline can be further divided into
three segments including the northeast, middle and southeast limbs
(Abrajevitch et al., 2008) and West Junggar probably represents an
extension of the Chingiz Arc of the NE limbs (Zhao and He, 2013).
The Junggar Block is located in the core of the Northern Xinjiang area
(Fig. 1a) and mostly covered by Mesozoic to Cenozoic sediments. The
basement to the block has been a controversial issue and many hypoth-
eses have been proposed including a Precambrian crust (Zhang et al.,
1984; Chen et al., 2002), a Carboniferous back-arc basin (Hsu, 1989),
or an early to middle Paleozoic oceanic crust trapped during the Late
Paleozoic (Feng et al., 1989; Chen and Jahn, 2004). Based on available
geological, geochemical and geophysical data from the margin of the
Junggar Basin and preliminary borehole evidence, Xiao et al. (2008) pro-
pose that the Junggar Block comprises a collage of arcs, accretionary
complexes and trapped oceanic crust. While the Junggar Block has pre-
viously been considered to be an eastern extension of the Kazakhstan
Plate (Zhang et al., 1984), new studies carried out in the NW margin
of the Junggar Basin de?ne a suture zone between West Junggar and
the Junggar Block (e.g. Zhang et al., 2011). The exact boundaries of the
Junggar Block are not very clear while some paleogeographic studies
(e.g. Zhang et al., 2011) show that the western boundary of the block
is limited by the Baogutu Arc and formerly parallel to the Darbut fault.
Southward subduction of the Junggar Ocean led to amalgamation of
the consolidated Junggar Block with the Yili每Central Tianshan terrane in
the Late Permian (Xiao et al., 2008). The amalgamation between West
Junggar and Junggar Block is more complicated and a double subduction
system and ridge subduction were probably involved (Zhang et al.,
2011). In this scenario, a fore-arc accretionary complex and an intra-
oceanic arc are considered to have developed at the western and eastern
sides of the Darbut trench respectively (Zhang et al., 2011). For this
reason, the Karamay unit, located between the eastern side of West
Junggar and the Junggar Basin, should probably not be treated as a
part of West Junggar.
In order to simplify the discussion, the ※West Junggar§as used in this
paper is de?ned by the geographic ※West Junggar§with exclusion of the
Karamay unit from the southeast margin and it can thus probably be
treated as a southeast extension of the Kazakhstan Plate (Zhao and He,
2013, Fig. 1b). West Junggar can be further divided into three parts,
namely the Irtysh-Zaisan zone in the north, the Chingiz每Tarbagatay
Paleozoic arc belt (including the Tacheng Basin) in the middle and the
North Balkhash每West Junggar belt in the southeast (Feng et al., 1989;
Zhao and He, 2013, Fig. 1b). The large-scale strike-slip faults comprising
the Irtysh每Zaisan Shear Zone (IZSZ) and North Tianshan Fault (NTF)
de?ne the tectonic boundaries with Siberia to the north and the Yili
Block to the south (Fig. 1a, b).
Late Paleozoic volcanic and sedimentary rocks are widely distributed
in the north and south of the Tacheng Basin (Fig. 1c). In the Tarbagatay
Mountain region in the north of the basin, the Upper Devonian strata are
assigned to the Tarbagatay Formation with a thickness of ~2000每
5000 m mainly composed of sandstones and siltstones in the lower
part and basalts, tufs and tuffaceous conglomerates in the upper part
(XBGMR, 1985). The sporadically-distributed lower Permian strata are
referred to the Haerjiawu Formation in this area and have a highly
variable thickness between 250 and 2000 m; they are mainly composed
of tuffs and basalts with interbedded marls; the appearance of
Noeggerathiopsis cf. theodiri indicates a C2P1 age (XBGMR, 1985). In
the south of the Tacheng Basin near the town of Yumin, the Upper
Devonian strata are assigned to the Tielieketi Formation; this unit is
lithologically-similar to the Tarbagatay Formation and the appearance
of LeptophloeumrhombicumDaws in the lower part indicates a late

864 Z. Yi et al. / Gondwana Research 27 (2015) 862每877


Devonian (D3) age. The Upper Carboniferous units comprise the
Molaoba Formation with a thickness of ~2000 m; a succession of lava
?ows with columnar jointing is developed in the upper part of this
formation (XBGMR, 1975).
The northern Balkash每West Junggar area has experienced three
major phases of deformation since Late Paleozoic times, including the
Telbes phase in D3 time, the Saur phase near C1/C2 boundary and a
Sayak phase near the P1/P2 boundary (Milanovsky, 1996). In the
Tacheng Basin, two phases of deformation are recognized in the studied
units. In the area of the Kalabula River, a distinct unconformity devel-
oped between the D3 Tielieketi and C2 Molaoba formations (XBGMR,
1975), and probably records the Saur event. A layer of conglomerates
has developed at the bottom of the P1 level where Haerjiawu and
Chidi formations overlap the older Paleozoic rocks with unconformity
(XBGMR, 1975, 1985); representing that an important tectonic event
therefore occurred near the C2/P1 boundary.

2.2. Sampling

The sampling area is near the city of Tacheng and is located in Fig. 1c.
The lithologies of the sampled rocks are mainly tuffs, tuf?tes and basalts
in addition to 5 sites collected from sandstones and one site from a
dolerite dyke. Thirteen sites were collected from the D3 Tarbagatay
Formation in the Abudula River area (Section A) and Tielieketi Formation
in the Kalabula River area (Section B), 17 sites from the C2 Molaoba
Formation from the Kalabula (Section C) and Baiyibuxie River areas
(Section D) and 11 sites from the P1 Haerjiawu Formation in the
Wulasitai River area (Section E). A single basalt hand sample (xt154)
was collected for 40Ar/39Ar dating from the middle part of the Molaoba
Formation in the Kalabula River area (Section C, Fig. 1c). In general 8每10
distributed paleomagnetic samples were collected at each site with a
portable gasoline-powered drill; the ?eld cores were oriented in situ
by both magnetic and sun compasses.
3. 40Ar/39Ar analytical methods and results

The whole rock sample for age dating was crushed and sieved
between 250 and 400 米m fractions and thoroughly washed with dis-
tilled water and acetone. Groundmass was carefully hand-picked
using a binocular microscope to reduce visible impurities following
paramagnetic separation and the groundmass cleaned in 5% HNO3 for
5 min to reduce alteration effects. Samples were wrapped in aluminum
foil and irradiated together with Bern4M Muscovite standards moni-
tored in position B4 of the 49-2 reactor, Beijing, China, for 24 h. The
reference age for the Bern4M is 18.69 ㊣ 0.36 Ma (Baksi et al., 1996;
McDougal and Harrison, 1999). Incremental heating analyses of sam-
ples were performed at the Ar/Ar Geochronology Laboratory, Institute

of Geology and Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, on a
MM5400 mass spectrometer operating in a static mode. 40Ar, 39Ar,
38Ar, 37Ar and 36Ar isotopic abundances were determined through linear
extrapolation at time zero of peak intensities and the data were
corrected for system blanks, mass discriminations, interfering Ca, K
derived argon isotopes, and the decay of 37Ar since the time of the
irradiation. The decay constant used throughout the calculations is
竹 = (5.543 ㊣ 0.010) ℅ 10?10 a?1 as recommended by Steiger and
J?ger (1977) and further details of the analysis and data processing pro-
cedures are given in Wang et al. (2006) and Yang et al. (2008).
Usually plateau ages were de?ned as three or more contiguous steps
corresponding to a minimum of 50% of the 39Ar released and showing
no statistical difference in 95% con?dence level (McDougal and
Harrison, 1999). For slightly altered volcanic rocks it can be dif?cult to
meet the criteria critically, but we can still trust the results in most
cases if 39Ar released is less than 50% but still more than 30% (Koppers
et al., 2000, 2011). In these cases we refer to the weighted plateau as a
mini-plateau or pseudo-plateau age and results of the 40Ar/39Ar experi-
ments are plotted as age spectrum and isotope correlation diagrams in
Fig. 2 with data summarized in Table 1.
The groundmass from basaltic lava xt154 yields an age spectrum
which is basically concordant with the exception of several initial
steps with slightly higher ages due to 39Ar recoil (Fig. 2a). Eight subse-
quent steps account for 41.3% of the total 39Ar released and de?ne a
mini plateau age of 304.1 ㊣ 1.9 Ma (2考, MSWD = 1.9). An inverse
isochron age of 304.0 ㊣ 4.7 Ma (2考, MSWD = 2.2) calculated from
the same steps is in agreement with the plateau age. The 40Ar/36Ar inter-
cept of 297.7 ㊣ 68.3 (2考) is no different from the air ratio but has large
uncertainty due to the very high radiogenic 40Ar content, indicating that
no excess argon contamination is present (Fig. 2b).
The inverse isochron age is more objective because no assumptions
are made about the initial 40Ar/36Ar ratios. We therefore prefer the
inverse isochron age and take 304.0 ㊣ 4.7 Ma as the time of lava erup-
tion. Since the latest Carboniferous isotope age is derived from near the
top of the Molaoba Formation that has a biostratigraphic age of C2P1
time, thus the age of the Molaoba Formation can be constrained to the
Late Carboniferous.

4. Paleomagnetic analysis

4.1. Laboratory methods

Standard 2.5 cm cylindrical specimens were cut from ?eld core
samples and selected fresh end material was subject to rock magnetic
analysis. Thermomagnetic analysis and acquisition of isothermal rema-
nent magnetization (IRM) were conducted to identify the main magnetic
minerals in the collected samples. Thirteen pilot samples were subject

to thermomagnetic analysis of remanence or magnetic susceptibility
(MS) during heating-cooling runs from room temperature to 700 ∼C
in an argon environment. This procedure used a variable ?eld transla-
tion balance (VFTB) and a CS-3 apparatus coupled to a KLY-3
kappabridge, respectively. Analysis of acquisition of IRM was conducted
to 11 samples with a Princeton/Micromag 3900; stepwise magnetiza-
tion from 0.01 to 1.2 Tesla (T) was applied to the samples and the inten-
sity was measured after each step of magnetization.
All specimens were subject to progressive thermal demagnetization
using an ASC Model TD-48 oven with residual magnetic ?eld minimized
to less than 10 nT inside the cooling chamber. Demagnetization inter-
vals were 50 ∼C or 100 ∼C to 500 ∼C, subsequently reduced to steps of
30 ∼C, 20 ∼C or 10 ∼C as the maximum unblocking temperatures of the
remanence carriers were approached. Magnetizations were measured
using a 2G-755R cryogenic magnetometer and performed in the
Paleomagnetism and Geochronology Laboratory (PGL) of the Institute
of Geology and Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences where mag-
netometers and demagnetizers are installed in a magnetically shielded
room with ambient ?eld minimized to less than 300 nT. Demagnetiza-
tion results were evaluated using stereographic projections and orthog-
onal projections (Zijderveld, 1967) with the latter used to resolve
component structures. Equivalent component directions were calculated
by principal component analysis (Kirschvink, 1980) with at least ?ve
successive steps. The interval-mean results were determined using the
standard Fisherian statistics (Fisher, 1953) or a method of combined
remagnetization circles and direction observations (McFadden and
McElhinny, 1988).

4.2. Measurement results

Most specimens from basalts, tuffs and tuf?tes in this study show a
rapid increase in IRM intensity in applied ?elds below 0.3 T followed
by complete saturation and indicating that these rock facies are domi-
nated by low-coercivity ferromagnets (Fig. 3b每e). Thermomagnetic
analysis identi?es two main falls in saturation remanence at ~300每
400 ∼C and ~580 ∼C, and the well-determined ChRM directions are
mostly isolated by thermal demagnetization between ~300 ∼C and
580 ∼C (Fig. 3b每e), again indicating that the main magnetic mineral is
low-Ti titanomagnetite. The magnetic mineralogy of the sandstone
samples is apparently more complex although magnetite is identi?ed
as the main magnetic carrier from observation of the rapid fall in mag-
netic susceptibility at ~580 ∼C complemented by the well-determined
ChRMs between ~300 and 530 ∼C (Fig. 3a).
For most specimens, a low-temperature component paralleling the
present geomagnetic ?eld (PGF) is removed during thermal demagneti-
zation below ~200每300 ∼C and a reverse polarity is revealed by the
high-temperature component isolated from ~250每350 ∼C to ~ 530每
580 ∼C (Fig. 3). Site-mean ChRM directions are listed in Tables 2每3,

and statistical results for each unit of the sampling area are discussed
below.

4.2.1. Abudula River area (D3, Tarbagatay Formation, Section A)
The lithology of sampled rocks in this area is sandstone. The 3 signif-
icant sites (XT130每132) yield an interval-mean direction of D = 167.1∼,
I = ?21.7∼ (汐95 = 7.4∼) before and D = 176.3∼, I = 1.0∼ (汐95 = 9.5∼)
after tilt correction (Table 2).

4.2.2. Kalabula River area
Two late Paleozoic formations were sampled in this area, including
the D3 Tielieketi Formation exposed in the south and the C2 Molaoba
Formation in the north (Fig. 1c).

4.2.2.1. Tielieketi Formation (D3, Section B). Tuf?tes and tuffaceous
sandstone samples of D3 age were collected from 10 sites south of the
Kalabula River area (Fig. 1c). The 9 grouped site-mean directions yield
an interval-mean direction of D = 194.6∼, I = ?53.8∼ (汐95 = 7.6∼)
before and D = 308.1∼, I = 70.3∼ (汐95 = 16.2∼) after tilt adjustment
(Fig. 4a每b, Table 2). A signi?cant outlying site (xt138) is excluded
from calculation of the group-mean direction (Fig. 4a). The fold test
(Watson and Enkin, 1993) is negative with an optimal concentration
at 10.3% unfolding and 95% uncertainty ranging from 5.9 to 14.7%
unfolding (Fig. 4c) indicative of a post-folding origin for the ChRMs.

4.2.2.2. Molaoba Formation (C2, Section C). Basalts and tuffs of C2 age
were collected from 9 sites north of the Kalabula River area (Fig. 1c).
Five signi?cant sites from basalts from the north (Section C-1) yield
an interval-mean direction of D = 185.9∼, I = ?84.6∼ (汐95 = 6.2∼)
before and D = 200.2∼, I = ?57.1∼ (汐95 = 7.2∼) after tilt adjustment
(Table 3); the fold test performed to this unit is inconclusive due to
the similar bedding attitudes. The other 4 sites collected about 0.5 km
south (Section C-2) to the basaltic sites yield an interval-mean direction
of D = 173.4∼, I = ?63.2∼ (汐95 = 8.8∼) before and D = 192.4∼,
I = ?71.5∼ (汐95 = 14.7∼) after tilt adjustment (Table 3). The fold test
(Watson and Enkin, 1993) for these sites is negative as indicated
by an optimal concentration at 7.7% unfolding with 95% uncertainty
ranging from 0.6% to 15.1% unfolding implying a post-folding origin
for the ChRMs. In the Section C-2, a number of granite dykes are
observed to intrude the sampled tuffs and this overprint has possibly
resulted from thermal remagnetization by these dykes.

4.2.3. Baiyibuxie River area (C2 Molaoba Formation, Section D)
Eight sites of the C2 tuf?tes, rhyolitic tuffs were collected from the
Baiyibuxie River area (Fig. 1c). Seven signi?cant sites yield an interval-
mean direction of D = 334.9∼, I = ?57.1∼ (汐95 = 11.8∼) before and
D = 196.3∼, I = ?47.4∼ (汐95 = 6.5∼) after tilt correction (Table 3); a
further site in rhyolitic tuffs yielding an outlying site-mean direction is

excluded from calculation of the unit-mean direction. The remaining
data grouping is signi?cantly improved by tilt correction with
ks/kg = 3.187 and the magnetization is therefore possibly pre-folding
in origin (Table 3).

4.2.4. Wulasitai River area (P1, Haerjiawu Formation, Section E)
Eleven sites in P1 tuffs, basalts and sandstones were collected from
the Wulasitai River area (Fig. 1c) and 8 signi?cant sites in tuffs and
basalts yield an interval-mean direction of D = 152.9∼, I = ?67.6∼
(汐95 = 5.5∼) before and D = 169.6∼, I = ?41.0∼ (汐95 = 6.8∼) follow-
ing tilt adjustment (Table 3). Two site-mean directions from sandstones

are excluded because they deviate signi?cantly from the magnetization
in the volcanic rocks both before and after tilt correction. The fold test is
inconclusive due of the similar bedding attitudes. A further site in a
dolerite dyke with vertical orientation yields a site-mean direction of
D = 194.0∼, I = ?67.1∼ (汐95 = 4.9∼) which is marginally different
from the mean in-situ direction of the 8 sites from the volcanic rocks
with an angular difference of 18.0∼ ㊣ 5.4∼(Table 3). Although this may
suggest that the magnetization ages for the dyke and country rocks
are slightly different, it cannot be regarded as a positive contact test
because only one dyke has been sampled and paleo-secular variation
is thus not convincely averaged.

4.3. Reliability and age of the magnetic remanence

Excluding consideration of a low temperature component parallel to
the present geomagnetic ?eld, high-temperature ChRM components
have been isolated from each unit in late Paleozoic rocks of the Tacheng
Basin (Tables 2每3). In this paper, we estimate the age of magnetization
in accordance with the following factors: (1) the age of the rocks;
(2) the age of magnetization relative to the folding, either as pre- or
post-folding in origin; and (3) comparison of the observed inclinations
with the predicted ones from the APW path for Baltica (Torsvik et al.,
2012) as suggested by Abrajevitch et al. (2008). If the ChRM direction
fails to pass a fold test, the magnetization is interpreted as ※secondary§,
and the age of magnetization is determined by correlating the observed
inclination to the predicted inclination curve (Fig. 5). Conversely, if the
site-mean ChRM direction passes a fold test, the magnetization age is
further constrained by the folding age.
Among the 17 sites from the C2 Molaoba Formation (Section C and D,
Fig. 1c, Table 3), 4 sites (xt155每158, from Section C-2) were excluded
from calculation of the group-mean direction due to probable
thermal overprinting (see Section 4.2.2.2) and a site (xt146) yielding
an outlying direction is also excluded. The remaining 12 sites give an
interval-mean direction of D = 330.7∼, I = ?72.8∼ (汐95 = 12.6∼) be-
fore and D = 197.7∼, I = ?51.6∼ (汐95 = 5.0∼) after tilt correction
with positive fold test (Fig. 4d每f, Table 3) suggesting a pre-folding
origin (assigned to component B1). Because the last major phase of
folding in the Tacheng Basin probably occurred near the C/P boundary,
the magnetization ages is likely to be earlier than Early Permian.
From consideration of the isotope age (~304 Ma) from the upper part
of the Molaoba Formation, we are inclined to interpret this remanence
as primary in origin or acquired shortly after eruption of the volcanics
(i.e. during the C2 time). This age budget is compatible with the
exclusively reversed polarity probably acquired during the Kiaman
Reversed Superchron (ca. 325每250 Ma, Hounslow et al., 2004).
Furthermore, the observed tilt-corrected inclination of 51.6∼ also
agrees well with the predicted C2 inclination at the sampling area
(Fig. 5).

Of the 13 sites collected from the D3 Tarbagatay and Tielieketi forma-
tions (Sections A and B, Fig. 1c, Table 3), 3 sites (xt130每132) from the
Abudula River (Section A) and one site (xt138) from the Kalabula
River were excluded from calculation of group-mean directions due
to their outlying site-mean directions. The nine other signi?cant sites
collected from the Tielieketi Formation in the Kalabula River area yield
a post-folding ChRM component (assigned to component A, see
Section 4.2.2.1, Table 3). The in-situ direction of this secondary rema-
nence is indistinguishable from the C2 pre-folding remanence resolved
from the Molaoba Formation with an insigni?cant angular difference
of 2.9∼ ㊣ 6.7∼ suggesting that the overprint was acquired very close to
the age of component B1, i.e., during the C2 time.
The magnetization age for the P1 Haerjiawu Formation (Section E,
Fig. 1c, Table 3) however, remains poorly-constrained by an inconclu-
sive fold test. Nevertheless, interpreting the site-mean ChRM direction
as pre-folding in origin seems to be somewhat unreasonable since the
tilt-corrected inclination of 41∼ signi?cantly deviates from the post-P1
reference inclination (Fig. 5). Contrastingly, the in-situ direction of this
component is not signi?cantly different from the one resolved from
the section C-2 (the latter hereafter assigned to component B2); the
angular difference is 6.6∼ ㊣ 7.9∼ and the latter result was suggested to
be secondary in origin (see Section 4.2.2.2). A group-mean applied
to the 4 sites from the section C-2 and 9 sites from the Haerjiawu
Formation (the latter hereafter assigned to component C) yield an
interval-mean direction of D = 163.4∼, I = ?66.4∼ (汐95 = 4.9∼) before
and D = 174.8∼, I = ?52.3∼ (汐95 = 9.8∼) after tilt correction with data
grouping signi?cantly decreased by tilt correction with ks/kg = 0.260
(Fig. 4g, h, Table 3). Analysis using the Watson and Enkin (1993) test
highlights an optimal concentration at 18.8% unfolding with 95% uncer-
tainty ranging from 13.9 to 23.7% unfolding and this con?dently
supports a post-folding origin for the ChRM (component B2 + C,
Fig. 4i). Plotting the observed inclination of 66.4∼ on the reference
inclination curve suggests a late Permian to early Triassic overprint
(Fig. 5) with the exclusive reversed polarity further suggesting that
this overprint was probably acquired during the KRS (ca. 325每
250 Ma). Moreover, in both areas (sections C-2 and E), the sampled

successions have been intruded by a number of dykes which have
possibly caused thermal remagnetization. It is well known that West
Junggar experienced several generations of magmatic activity that
reached peaks at ~300 Ma and 260 Ma in times characterized by intru-
sion of dyke swarms (Choulet et al., 2011); hence the observed dykes in
the study areas most likely have a Late Permian age. By integrating the
above information we propose that the most likely magnetization age
of component B2 + C is the Late Permian (Fig. 5).
From the above analysis, three ChRM components can be reliably
isolated from the Late Paleozoic rocks of the Tacheng Basin and yield
three paleomagnetic poles meriting tectonic interpretation. There
are: (1) 70.7∼N, 209.0∼E (A95 = 8.5∼) for the C2 Molaoba Formation

with a pre-folding magnetization age of Late Carboniferous (ca. 320每
304 Ma); (2) 74.5∼N, 211.1∼E (A95 = 8.5∼) for the D3 Tielieketi
Formation with a magnetization age of the C2 and (3) 12.1∼N, 78.4∼E
(A95 = 7.5∼) for the C2 Molaoba and P1 Haerjiawu formations with a
most probable magnetization age of the P2 (Table 3).

available data from the Karamay unit and Hoboksar, Choulet et al.
(2011) de?ne two mean paleomagnetic poles for West Junggar
with C2-P and P2 ages respectively at 68.2∼N, 326.7∼E (A95 = 12.6∼)
and 53.0∼N, 183.9∼E (A95 = 16.6∼) (Fig. 7, Table 4). However, these
paleopoles cannot be used with con?dence because (1) as discussed
in Section 2, the tectonic af?nity of the Karamay unit is unclear;
(2) the Karamay unit is located very close to the suture zone between
West Junggar and Junggar and could have suffered signi?cant local
deformation and (3) the inclination of 49.0∼ resolved from the P2 pole
for the Karamay unit is suspiciously shallower than results from
adjacent blocks such as West Junggar, Junggar and even Tarim Block
to the south (Fig. 7d). For these reasons, the tectonic discussions on
the basis of this dataset, either for West Junggar or for Junggar, should
be considered with caution.
In addition to our study in the Tacheng Basin, Li et al. (1991) reported
two paleomagnetic poles from Bulungou and Heshantou formations
near the Hoboksar at eastern margin of the ※West Junggar§ as de?ned

in this paper (Fig. 7, Table 4). In Bulungou village, 15 sites of volcanic
rocks were collected from the C2 Harlegiawu and Karlargang formations
in a syncline trending in NNW每SSE. The site-mean ChRM directions pass
a fold test and yield a paleopole at 70∼N, 299∼E (A95 = 6.4∼). In
Heishantou village 26 sites were collected from limestones and sand-
stones from the D3 Honggulerun Formation, the lower Carboniferous
Heshantou and Sarlebulake formations as well from plutons and
dykes intruded into the Honggulerun Formation. The site-mean ChRM
directions are interpreted as pre-folding remagnetizations and yield a
paleomagnetic pole at 69∼N, 350∼E (A95 = 7.5∼). The age of this over-
print is poorly constrained to be Late Carboniferous to Permian in age.
The two poles are not consistent and suggest minor relative rotation
probably due to an age difference.
In the middle limb of the Kazakhstan Orocline, Abrajevitch et al.
(2008) report a paleomagnetic study of latest Carboniferous to
late Permian rocks from Tokrau (Fig. 7, Table 4). Primary magnetiza-

and late Permian ages respectively and a secondary magnetization
has further de?ned a pole likely to be of early Triassic age (Fig. 7,
Table 4).
In the northeastern limb at Ayaguz-A and B, Levashova et al. (2003a)
sampled the Bakalin Formation (with a late Permian age), and primary
remanences with distinct declination differences were isolated from
both localities. In later studies, the authors argued that Ayaguz-A had
probably experienced some local rotation since the Permian
(Levashova et al., 2009, 2012). However, at the same locality near
Ayaguz-A, Abrajevitch et al. (2008) sampled the Koldar Formation
with C2P1 age and all sampling sites were distributed within ~10 km
of Ayaguz-A although crossing several local faults. Both primary and
secondary remanences were isolated and yield two paleomagnetic
poles of C2P1 and P2 ages. The secondary P2 paleopole is very close to
the other late Permian poles reported by Collins et al. (2003) and
Levashova et al. (2003a,b) from different areas of the Chingiz Range
(with the exception of one obtained from Ayaguz-A by Levashova
et al., 2003a). Thus suggests that insigni?cant post-Permian relative ro-
tation has evidently occurred within the western part of the Chingiz
Range. The 6 paleopoles de?ne a mean late Permian pole for the west-
ern part of the Chingiz Arc at 44.9∼N, 154.0∼E (A95 = 13.1∼) (Table 4).
Comparing the C2P1 pole with the late Permian pole identi?es CW rota-
tions of 30∼ to 40∼ during the C2 to P2 interval.
At the southern margin near the Urumqi, nine paleomagnetic poles
are available for the Junggar Block. Removing two C2 poles reported
by Li et al. (1991) as suggested by Choulet et al. (2011), the remaining
seven C2, P1, P2 and T1 poles are essentially insigni?cantly-different
and the four P2 poles de?ne a mean P2 pole for the Junggar Block at
77.2∼N, 2.9∼E (A95 = 16.8∼) (Fig. 6d, Table 4).

5.2. Rotations

To further investigate the rotation pattern around West Junggar and
adjacent area we calculate declinations from the paleomagnetic poles
and plot their distributions on the geological map (Fig. 6). An equal-
area plot for declinations derived from selected paleopoles is also
carried out to estimate relative motions between the different areas
(Fig. 6).
The pre-folding component isolated from the C2 units and secondary
one from the D3 volcanic rocks yields very consistent paleomagnetic
poles for the Tacheng Basin (Fig. 6a, Table 4). However, the C2
paleopoles obtained from West Junggar are not consistent and de?ne
a counterclockwise (CCW) rotation of ~30∼ for the Hoboksar relative
to the Tacheng Basin (Fig. 6a, Table 4). The possible explanations for
this bias could be (1) as shown in the geological map (Fig. 7), the
Hoboksar is located at the eastern margin of West Junggar where arc
building (Zhang et al., 2011), oceanic crust and ridge subduction
(Geng et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2011) as well as strike-slip faulting
(Choulet et al., 2012; Ma et al., 2012) could occur during closure of the
Darbut Ocean during C2 and P1 times. These events together with subse-
quent amalgamation of West Junggar and Junggar may have caused
rotations at the east margin of West Junggar (see Section 5.3.2) and
(2) the geological trend line in the Tacheng Basin is approximately
west to east whilst it becomes southwest to northeast at Hoboksar
(Fig. 6) suggesting that CCW rotations could have occurred at the
eastern margin of West Junggar relative to the Tacheng Basin. For this
reason, to avoid the uncertainties introduced by possible local rotations,
we prefer to use the paleomagnetic data from the Tacheng Basin for
interpreting the tectonic history of West Junggar.
Comparing the C2 and P2 poles for the Tacheng Basin reveals a signif-
icant CW rotation of 35.6∼ ㊣ 10.4∼ for West Junggar during C2 to P2
times (Fig. 6c, Table 4). This rotation pattern is similar to that observed
from the western part of the Chingiz Range in Kazakhstan where a
signi?cant CW rotation of 41.1∼ ㊣ 14.9∼ was also de?ned on the basis
of comparison of the C2P1 and P2 paleomagnetic poles (Fig. 6c). Further-
more, after correcting the post-Permian CCW rotation of 81.4∼ ㊣ 16.9∼
for the Tacheng Basin relative to the western part of the Chingiz Arc
(Figs. 6c, 7), the derived C2 declination for the Tacheng Basin would be
rotated to 107.8∼ ㊣ 14.3∼, which is very similar to the C2 declination ob-
tained from the Ayaguz (105.3∼ ㊣ 8∼) and suggests that West Junggar
and Chingiz comprised a rigid block by P2 time.
The C2 poles for West Junggar and Junggar are signi?cantly different
while the P2 poles overlap with an angular difference of 2.3∼ ㊣ 13.5∼
(Fig. 6b, Table 4); this indicates that the two blocks were probably
separated during C2 time and sutured to become a rigid block from P2
time onwards; the implication is that amalgamation of West Junggar
and Junggar most probably occurred during the C2 to P2 interval.
A large CCW rotation of 81.4∼ ㊣ 16.9∼ is identi?ed between West
Junggar and Junggar relative to the western part of the Chingiz Arc
from comparison of the P2 poles for the Tacheng, Junggar and Chingiz
Range (Fig. 6c, d). This rotation suggests that large-scale deformation
has occurred between the consolidated West Junggar-Junggar Terrane
and the main part of the Kazakhstan Orocline since P2 time.

5.3. Tectonic and geodynamic implications

5.3.1. Oroclinal bending
No important relative motion is recognized between the western
part of the Chingiz Arc and West Junggar during the C2 to P2 interval
(Fig. 6c) and the similar rotation pattern suggests that the Chingiz每
West Junggar remained as a quasi-rigid block constituting the northeast
limb of the Kazakhstan Orocline, at least by the P2 time.
A tectonic af?liation between the Chingiz Arc and West Junggar
Terrane has been advocated for a long time (e.g. Samygin, 1974), but
this connection was only demonstrated recently by a cross-border
study carried out in China and Kazakhstan (Zhao and He, 2013).

Fig. 5. Age-correlation diagram for the Tacheng magnetizations. The magnetostratigraphic
scale has been compiled from Ogg and Smith (2004). The reference inclination curve
for the Tacheng Basin is obtained by extrapolation from the global APWP in Baltica coor-
dinates (Torsvik et al., 2012). The horizontal dimension of the rectangle boxes illustrate
the age ranges of the sampled units that we consider most representative of the strati-
graphic age-range of the studied rocks or possible ages of the remagnetizations in accor-
dance with correlation of the observed and reference inclinations. Vertical dimensions
are de?ned by the 95% con?dence level of the corresponding collection-mean inclinations.
The peaks of magmatism in West Junggar area are marked by the red arrows which likely
caused the remagnetization. All the magnetizations are characterized by reversed polarity
probably suggesting that they were acquired during the long Kiaman Reversed
Superchron (~325每250 Ma). See text for further discussion.

Comparisons of stratigraphy and ophiolites suggest that the Chingiz每
Tarbagatay每Xiemisitai and Northern Balkhash每West Junggar are geo-
logically comparable although some units have been signi?cantly
displaced for several tens to hundreds of kilometers by a set of dextral
strike-slip faults (Zhao and He, 2013).
The 41.1∼ ㊣ 16.9∼ CW rotation that occurred in the western part of
the Chingiz Range during the C2P1 to P2 interval (Figs. 6b, 7) was
interpreted as oroclinal bending of the NE arm of Kazakhstan Arc
(Abrajevitch et al., 2008). However, since Permian wrench tectonics is
widely observed in eastern Kazakhstan, this rotation could potentially
be interpreted as local deformation (Van der Voo et al., 2006;
Abrajevitch et al., 2008; Levashova et al., 2012). In this study, a similar
magnitude of CW rotation (35.6∼ ㊣ 10.4∼) is well de?ned in the Tacheng
Basin and suggests that local pre-P2 rotation within the Chingiz-West
Junggar belt is paleomagnetically-insigni?cant. The C2 and P2 poles
deduced from the middle arm of the Kazakhstan Orocline (Abrajevitch
et al., 2008) are both in good agreement with the APW path of
the Baltica (Torsvik et al., 2012) and reveal an intergral CW rotation of
ca. 10∼. Following correction for this background rotation, the northeast
limb of the Kazakhstan Orocline, including the Chingiz Range and West
Junggar Terrane, is found to have rotated ca. 25∼ to 30∼ CW with respec-
tive to the middle limb during the C2 to P2 interval. Since the relative
CW rotation between the northern and southern limbs of the Kazakh-
stan Orocline was initiated as early as Devonian每Early Carboniferous
times (Collins et al., 2003; Levashova et al., 2003b, 2007; Abrajevitch
et al., 2007) as a result of oroclinal bending, the observed CW rotation

of ca. 25∼ to 30∼ during the C2 to P2 interval, is hence likely a continua-
tion of the ongoing rotation and hence strongly supports the model of
oroclinal bending.

5.3.2. Closure of the Balkhash每Junggar Ocean
To better understand the evolution history of the Balkhash每Junggar
Ocean during the Late Paleozoic, we reconstruct West Junggar in frames
of the Kazakhstan Orocline and PAO tectonic domain respectively
(Fig. 8). Firstly, the shapes of the Kazakhstan Orocline during different
time intervals of the Late Paleozoic are restored on the basis of paleo-
magnetic data as recently summarized by Levashova et al. (2012).
With the concept in mind that West Junggar is an extension of the
Chingiz Arc, we restore West Junggar in the Kazakhstan Orocline with
West Junggar rotated in accordance with paleo-orientations deter-
mined by the newly-obtained paleomagnetic data from the Tacheng
Basin (Table 4). Finally, we restore the Kazakhstan Orocline in the PAO
tectonic domain where major blocks are positioned in accordance
with the new APW paths of Siberia and Baltica (Torsvik et al., 2012)
and Tarim (Huang et al., 2008).
As shown in the reconstruction plot (Fig. 8), a signi?cant relative
rotation of at least ca. 40∼ should have occurred between the northern
and southern arms of the Kazakhstan Orocline during the C2 to P2 inter-
val. Another notable feature indicated by this scenario is a large gap of
several hundreds of kilometers still present between the northern and
southern arms of the Kazakhstan Orocline at ca. 320每304 Ma (Fig. 8a)
probably suggesting that the Balkash每Junggar Ocean had not closed by

the Late Carboniferous. Moreover, comparison of the C2 poles between
the Tacheng Basin and Junggar also indicates that West Junggar and
Junggar were separated during the C2 time (Fig. 6b). These ?ndings
support the existence of a Paleo-Balkash每Junggar Ocean at least several
hundreds of kilometers in width during C2 time. Afterwards, with
further bending of the Kazakhstan Orocline during the C2 to P2, the
Balkhash每Junggar Ocean closed gradually. The ?nal amalgamation of
West Junggar and Junggar is de?ned by the overlap of P2 poles of the
two units.
When we consider the regional tectonics of the Junggar area in this
period, an important feature for consideration is the late Carboniferous-
early Permian ridge subduction in West Junggar, which probably
records the closure of an arc-related basin (the Darbut Ocean)
(Fig. 8a; Geng et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2011). The boundaries of the
Darbut Ocean are unknown in detail; however, due to its siting as a
back-arc basin we propose that it comprised a Philippine Sea-type
basin with a rhomb-shape, or at least a semi-rhomb form. The ?nal
phase of the late Carboniferous每early Permian ridge subduction of the
Darbut Ocean is represented by the two sets of orthogonal Sanukitoid
dykes with an emplacement age constrained to the interval ca. 305每
296 Ma (Ma et al., 2012); this could have been the last phase of the
closure of the arc-related Darbut Ocean and is compatible with our
reconstruction based on the paleomagnetic data.
In the regions of the northern Balkhash to the southern West
Junggar, a succession of marine clastic rocks and pyroclastic sediments
of ?ysch facies developed along the innermost zone of the Kazakhstan
Orocline during the Late Paleozoic (Milanovsky, 1996) and records a

tectonic environment of subduction and accretion. The ※Sayak event§
occurred near the P1/P2 boundary and probably records a weak orogenic
event marking ?nal amalgamation between the northern and southern
arms of the Kazakhstan Orocline. The early to late Permian sediments
along this belt are characterize by a suite of sediments deposited in
lagoonal or residual marine facies (Milanovsky, 1996) and record a
contracting ocean basin. The sedimentary and tectonic evidence thus
collectively supports the existence of a Paleo-Balkhash-Junggar Ocean
during latest Carboniferous to Early Permian times and is in good agree-
ment with our paleomagnetic reconstructions.

5.3.3. Orocline disarticulation
The large scale CCW rotation of ~80∼ observed in West Junggar with
respect to the western part of the Chingiz Range probably represents an
important deformation within northeastern arm of the Kazakhstan
Orocline since P2 times. This deformation is referred to as ※orocline dis-
articulation§ because it occurred after consolidation of the Kazakhstan
Orocline in latest Paleozoic times (Levashova et al., 2003a,b; Van der
Voo et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2007) and was characterized by around-
vertical axis rotation interpreted as a response to dextral strike-slip
faulting on the Chingiz-Alakol-North Tianshan Fault (Choulet et al.,
2011, in press); this is also consistent with the geological history At
the Permian/Triassic boundary, a series of linear folds developed in
the region of northern Balkash and West Junggar as a consequence of
meridional compression (in the present-day coordinate system) and
these subsequently evolved into a set of dextral transpressive features
(Milanovsky, 1996) comprising zones known as ※the Main Chingiz

Fault§ (Milanovsky, 1996) or the Chingiz-Alakol-North Tianshan Fault
(CANTF, Choulet et al., 2011). The activity history of the CANTF lasted
from the Permian/Triassic boundary to the Late Triassic with a peak of
faulting in the interval 240 Ma to 220 Ma (Zonenshain et al., 1990)
and has presently separated West Junggar and Junggar from the
Kazakhstan Orocline. The well-coupled space and time linkage between
the faulting and rotation strongly suggests a close relationship in the
kinematics.
In addition to the rotation observed in West Junggar with respect to
Baltica Craton, similar CCW rotations up to ~90∼ are also widely
observed in Junggar, southeastern Kazakhstan and even Tarim and
record important deformation within the Asian continent (Van der
Voo et al., 2006). Moreover, since the closure of the Balkhash每Junggar
Ocean should have marked the beginning of intra-continental evolution
in the Junggar and adjacent region, these rotations are properly
interpreted as intra-continental deformations.
Nevertheless, the timing, kinematics and geodynamics for this
important deformation are currently poorly understood. Firstly the
large-scale deformations are only poorly constrained as ※post-Permian
rotations§ (Van der Voo et al., 2006) or assigned to Late Permian to
Mesozoic times (Choulet et al., 2013). Most authors propose that the ro-
tations are of a late Paleozoic to early Triassic age (e.g. Van der Voo et al.,
2006; Wang et al., 2007) because the contemporary transcurrent
faulting is widely documented and could reasonably explain these rota-
tions. However, according to a preliminary paleomagnetic study of the
Mesozoic rocks in the Junggar Block (Choulet et al., 2013), large scale
CCW rotations between the Junggar and Baltica are also documented
during early and late Triassic times (Fig. 7, Table 4) indicating that de-
formation has probably had a long history which was not complete by
the Early Triassic (Choulet et al., 2013).
The kinematics of this deformation is also not well clari?ed and
three alternative patterns could be explain the observed rotations
including (1) further bending of the Kazakhstan Orocline; (2) block

rotations and (3) small ball-bearing rotations and/or local rotations
caused by wrench faulting (Van der Voo et al., 2006). For the ?rst
pattern, at least several hundred kilometers of shortening is needed
which is hard to achieve in an intra-continental setting and thus appears
fairly unreasonable (Van der Voo et al., 2006). Furthermore, as sug-
gested by the studies in northern (Li et al., 1991 and this study) and
southern (e.g. Van der Voo et al., 2006) arms of the Kazakhstan Orocline,
large CCW rotations are both observed and which is not compatible
with the model of oroclinal bending. For the second pattern as proposed
by Wang et al. (2007) and Choulet et al. (2011, 2012, in press), the
※room problem§ seems unavoidable because both Wang et al. (2007)
and Choulet et al. (2011, 2012, in press) have proposed strike-slip
faulting of Yili and Junggar blocks along the large transcurrent faults in
an order of several hundreds to more than 1000 km. The last pattern,
which emphasizes the dragging effect of strike-slip faulting, was pro-
posed to best interpret the large-scale CCW observed in the southeast-
ern Kazakhstan and Tarim (Van der Voo et al., 2006). In this pattern,
the widely observed CCW rotations were interpreted as the sinistral
strike-slip faulting of a set of NEE trending faults developed during the
Late Permian to Early Triassic. However, challenges probably remain
for two reasons: (1) both sinistral and dextral strike-slip faults compris-
ing conjugate fault sets with offsets in opposite senses, were developed
during the Late Permian to Early Triassic, and the dextral ones have
dominated deformation in southwest and eastern Kazakhstan and in
the Northern Tianshan. Provided that the post-Permian block rotation
is mainly caused by strike-slip dragging, equivalent CW rotation at
least, should be observed. However, as shown in this study (Fig. 7), no
important such rotations are documented in the entire region except
for minor ones in the western part of the Chingiz Arc and (2) the overlap
of P2 poles of West Junggar and Junggar (Fig. 6d) suggests that an inte-
gral post-Permian rotation of the two units occurred and this is incom-
patible with local or ball-bearing rotation models. The discussion of the
three patterns listed above indicates that no single model can perfectly

explain the large scale CCW rotation observed in the Junggar and adja-
cent area and two or more succeeding tectonic regimes may be required
to explain rotations observed in different areas.
Two geodynamic models may reasonably be considered to explain
intra-continental deformation observed in the Junggar and adjacent
regions. These comprise (1) lateral convergence between the Siberia
and Baltica during the Late Permian to Early Triassic (Natal'in and

?eng?r, 2005 as proposed by Van der Voo et al., 2006) and (2) collision
of Asia with the Tibetan blocks during the Mesozoic (Choulet et al.,
2013). Both models support profound Mesozoic intra-continental
deformation in Eurasia following the terrane amalgamation by the latest
Paleozoic. Moreover, there is the added possibility that Eurasia was non-
rigid during the Late Cretaceous to Early Tertiary interval (Cogn谷 et al.,
1999, 2013) which suggests that Eurasia experienced polyphase

Balkhash-Junggar Ocean occurred during C2 to P2 time and (3) a large counterclockwise rotation of ~80∼ occurred in West Junggar and Junggar relative to the western part of the Chingiz
Range after P2. See text for more information.

paleomagnetic analysis.

6. Conclusions

Our combined geochronological and paleomagnetic study of Late
Paleozoic rocks in the Tacheng Basin has obtained a 40Ar/39Ar age of
304 ㊣ 4.7 Ma from lava in the upper part of the Late Carboniferous
Molaoba Formation and has documented several magnetization compo-
nents. A pre-folding ChRM component was obtained from the Late
Carboniferous Molaoba Formation and has yielded a paleomagnetic
pole at 70.7∼N, 209.0∼E (A95 = 5.0∼); Only a secondary component
could be isolated from the late Devonian Tielieketi Formation yielding
a paleopole at 74.5∼N, 211.1∼E (A95 = 8.5∼) which is indistinguishable
from the Molaoba pole thus probably indicating a late Carboniferous
age. In addition, the early Permian Haerjiawu Formation and one section
from the late Carboniferous Molaoba Formation which were intruded
by dolerite and granite dykes have de?ned a paleopole at 78.4∼N,
12.1∼E (A95 = 7.5∼), this pole is also interpreted as secondary in origin
and most probably of P2 age. Based on the analysis of available
paleomagnetic data from West Junggar and adjacent area, the tectonic
evolution of this area can be summarized as following:

(1) A rigid Chingiz-West Junggar arc de?ne the NE limb of the
Kazakhstan Orocline that experienced a signi?cant CW rotation
of ~35∼ to 40∼ during the late Carboniferous to late Permian;
this kinematics is compatible with models of oroclinal bending
and supports the view that at least a part of curvature of the
orocline was acquired during late Carboniferous to late Permian
times (Fig. 8);
(2) The late Carboniferous poles for West Junggar and the Junggar
Block are signi?cantly different whilst the late Permian ones
almost overlap indicating that amalgamation of West Junggar
and the Junggar Block occurred during late Carboniferous to
late Permian times and was accompanied by closure of the
Balkhash-Junggar Ocean (Fig. 8a, b).
(3) Closure of the Junggar Ocean probably marked the beginning of
intra-continental evolution in this area. Therefore, the observed
CCW rotation of ~80∼ to 90∼ between West Junggar and Junggar
relative to the western part of the Chingiz Arc since P2 times
probably represents important intra-continental deformation
within the western part of the Central Asia Orogenic Belt; this
rotation can be reasonably interpreted in terms of dextral
strike-slip faulting of the CANTF during latest Paleozoic to
Mesozoic times (Fig. 8b, c).

These new ?ndings suggest that West Junggar was not only involved
in large scale oroclinal bending of Kazakhstan arc, but also in large scale
intra-continental wrench tectonics. Hence it could play an important
role on understanding the tectonic evolution of western part of the
CAOB. Nevertheless, in view of the tectonic complexity of West Junggar
and adjacent area, more paleomagnetic data of Late Paleozoic and
Mesozoic ages are desirable to clarify the kinematic processes especially
during the Mesozoic time in the western part of the CAOB. Furthermore,
discussion on the kinematics and geodynamics of the post-Permian
intracontinental deformations in the Eurasia is seriously restricted by
factors including (1) accuracy of the APW paths of Baltica, Siberia
and Tarim since the Late Permian; (2) the quantity and quality of
paleomagnetic data available from the mobile orogenic belt in the
CAOB; (3) chronology and displacement constraints on the Mesozoic
strike-slip faults in Kazakhstan, Tianshan and adjacent areas and
(4) the timing and pattern of closure of the Paleo-and Meso-Tethys
oceans. More studies on Mesozoic paleomagnetism and structure
geology within the Asian continent are therefore required to further
understand the tectonic evolution of Eurasia.
